Diamond Drop In Javascript
==========================

This is a game engine for dropping diamond games implemented in Javascript.

## Introduction

A sample game in the app directory looks like this:

![Sample Diamond Game](/images/drop.png "Sample Diamond Game")

You can try out the game: http://jackherrington.com/diamond/#/

The important directories are:

/app - This has a sample application that you can run with 'grunt serve'.

/src - The diamond engine file.

## Using This

You should be able to:

```
bower install diamond
```

And then you can follow the patterns show in the app folder in main.js for an example of how to use the diamon library.

Good luck!

## History

I noticed on the BART a ridiculous number of people playing basically the same match three dropping game. And I said to myself; "I could write that." So I wrote it the first time really fast to make sure I could write it. And then I reimplemented it with unit tests and in an OO way, so that it can be reused.

The reason I put this much effort into the thing is that everytime I talk in front of a school about software engineering someone asks how to make games. And since I don't make games that's a tough question to answer. So, here is a game engine, change the colors and icons, add some levels logic, maybe add some new types of blocks, and have at it!
